# Data sources

Data sources are used to find players when adding them to a tournament.

In order to add players from the **FIDE players database**, it must first be downloaded and installed locally on your machine using Sharly Chess.

[Plugins]({% link docs/plugins/index.en.md %}) may also provide additional databases that behave the same way, or they may add support for online player databases.

## Installing databases on your machine

You can manage all local player databases from the **Data sources** page, accessible via the "Data sources" option in the navigation menu.

For each data source that's downloaded tp your machine, you can choose to:
- **Update automatically** when _Sharly Chess_ starts.
- **Receive a warning** when the database is outdated (based on the number of days you define).  In this case the "Data sources" option will display a warning sign.
- **Update manually** at any time â€” especially handy on the morning of a tournament.

This system ensures you always have the latest player info at your fingertips, without relying on an internet connection during the event.
