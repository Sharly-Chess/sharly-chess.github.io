# Getting Started

_Sharly Chess_ is a free, open-source, no-nonsense tool for managing individual chess tournaments.
It takes care of everything from check-ins and pairings to _FIDE_ exports.
Built with practical tournament needs for arbiters in mind, it also includes functionalities for organizers and players, with public display of pairings, results and countdown timers, as well as results input.

**_Sharly Chess_ runs completely autonomously** on the arbiter's computer:
Unlike many other solutions, **no internet connection is required during tournaments**
(you don't have to worry about network outages or the availability of an online server or hosting provider).

## France specific-ish, for now...

The current version of _Sharly Chess_ is **very** close to being suitable for chess tournaments organised anywhere in the world.
However, there is still a small amount of work to do on tie-break handling â€” some of the current algorithms are not *entirely* _FIDE_-compliant,
as they have been adapted to match the expectations of the French Chess Federation.

If you can accept a small discrepancy in these calculations, you can already use _Sharly Chess_ for tournaments outside France.
A fully compliant implementation will be available in the very near future.
