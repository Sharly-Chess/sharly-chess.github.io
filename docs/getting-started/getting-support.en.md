# Getting Support

To report an issue, get help, or simply give feedback to the _Sharly Chess_ developers, you can:

* Join the _Sharly Chess_ community on the project's [Discord server](https://discord.gg/at3d9WWJXu)
* Send a mail to [support@sharly-chess.com](mailto:support@sharly-chess.com)
* Open an issue on the [Sharly Chess GitHub repository](https://github.com/sharly-chess/sharly-chess/issues)

Support via Disord is the preferred way to get help, as it is the most active and responsive community.
