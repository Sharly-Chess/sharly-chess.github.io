# Installing _Sharly Chess_ on Windows

Sharly Chess is also available for [Mac]({% link docs/getting-started/installation-mac.en.md %}).

## Requirements

- Windows PC with up-to-date Windows 10+

## Installing _Sharly Chess_

{: .text-center }
[Download the latest release of _Sharly Chess_ (v{{ site.latest_version }})]({{ site.github_url }}/releases/download/{{ site.latest_version }}/sharly-chess-{{ site.latest_version }}-windows.zip){: .btn }

{: .note }

> :information_source: [See the changes of the latest release]({{ site.github_url }}/releases/latest)

1. Unzip the downloaded archive.
2. Inside, you’ll find a folder named after the version number. Move this folder to a location of your choice.
   We recommend placing it inside a parent folder named `sharly-chess` — this lets you keep multiple versions organized, and the automatic updater will install future versions into this same location.

## Running _Sharly Chess_

To start the application, simply double-click the `.exe` file inside the version folder.

When run for the first time you'll be asked to choose your language and it will open your default web browser to display the _Sharly Chess_ interface with the opportunity to configure your preferences.

On subsequent runs, _Sharly Chess_ will open the home page, where you can either access the admin interface or the client interface — which can be used by other devices on your network to display tournament information.
