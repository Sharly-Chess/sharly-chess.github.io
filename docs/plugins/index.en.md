# Plugins

_Sharly Chess_ is designed to be extensible, allowing you to add functionality to suit your needs and remove the ones you don't.

The core features of _Sharly Chess_ are intended to allow you to run a _FIDE_ style tournament, you can also add functionality to support specific federations, or to add additional features.

You can enable new plug-ins from the _Sharly Chess_ settings page. The enabled plug-ins can then be activated or deactivated for each event.  

Some plug-ins are specific to a federation, and can therefore only be activated for events of this federation.
