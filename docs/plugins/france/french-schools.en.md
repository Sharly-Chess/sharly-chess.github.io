# The _French Schools_ Plugin

{: .note }
> :information_source: **Dependency:** _FFE_

The **French Schools** plugin is designed to assist arbiters and organisers running tournaments for the **French Schools Championships**.

When enabled for an event, it:

* Adds a new local database type containing all schools and colleges in France (downloadable from _Data sources_)
* Adds a **School** field for each player
* Replaces the _Federation_, _League_, and _Club_ columns with the player's school in both screen and print views
* Adds a **School** column to the _Players_ tab in the admin interface
* Provides a **“Split by school”** option when printing
* Provides **prize criteria** by school and department
* Exports the school as the club when generating Papi files
* Includes the school in data sheet exports

## Usage

To make full use of this plugin, first download the **schools database** to your local machine via the **_Data sources_** section in the sidebar.

Once the database is installed, you can search for and assign schools by name using the **School** field in the player form.
