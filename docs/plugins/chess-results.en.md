This plug-in allows you to publish tournaments on the [_Chess-Results.com_](https://chess-results.com/Default.aspx?lan=1) website.

Manual uploading can be accessed from the side bar (`Upload` > `Chess-Results.com`).
You can also enable automatic uploads (via the tournament settings) so that any changes to the tournament are updated in real time on Chess-Results.com.

On the Tournaments tab, the tournament cards will provide links to access the tournament management interface on the Chess-Results.com website.
