This plugin allows uploading the tournaments to the [_Chess-Results.com_](https://chess-results.com/Default.aspx?lan=1) website.  

You can do it manually from the left navigation bar (`Upload` > `Chess-Results.com`). 
Once a tournament has been uploaded, you can enable the auto-upload such that any modification of the tournament would be updated in real time.  

You will find on the tournaments tab the links to access the management interface of the tournaments on the website.
