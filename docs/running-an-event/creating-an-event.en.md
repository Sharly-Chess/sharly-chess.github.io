# Creating an Event

Events are created from the arbiter’s home page by clicking the **Create Event** button.

Some basic information is required to set up an event, but most fields can be left with their default values and filled in later.

| **Public Event** | Relevant only if you're using other devices on your [network]({% link docs/network/index.en.md %}) to display [Screens]({% link docs/screens/index.en.md %}). Only events marked as _public_ will be accessible from those devices. |
| **Federation** | The chess federation responsible for the event. This information will be included in the TRF export.  Note that the availablility of federation specific plugins also depend on this field.  You can set a default federation for all Events in your _Sharly Chess_ settings. |
| **Name** | A user-friendly name, used for display purposes (e.g. on [Screens]({% link docs/screens/index.en.md %})).
| **Start/End** | The start and end dates of the event. Used for sorting events and included in the TRF export. |
| **Location** | The location of the event (e.g. city or venue). |
| **Player ratings to use by default** | Specifies if tournaments will use FIDE or national ratings by default.|

You can also activate any plugins that you'll need for this event.
