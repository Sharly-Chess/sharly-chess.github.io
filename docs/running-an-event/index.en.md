# Running an Event

## Overview

An **Event** in _Sharly Chess_ includes one or more individual **Tournaments** — typically grouped by rating ranges, though you're free to organize your event however you like.

You’ll probably want to create your Event well in advance and start adding players as they register.
_Sharly Chess_ makes it easy to pull players from the _FIDE_ database, as well as other sources depending on the plugins you’ve activated.
Once added, players can be moved between tournaments with just a few clicks.

On the day of the event, you can use _Sharly Chess_ to check-in players as they arrive. If you'd like, you can also set up tablets or laptops to let players check themselves in.

Once everyone is ready, you can generate pairings and start the tournaments.
The pairings can be printed or displayed via a projector if you have one available.

As the round progresses, you can enter results manually — or let players enter their own results using a tablet or computer.
If you're displaying the results on a screen, players can verify that their game was recorded correctly. This saves the arbiter time and reduces the chance of entry errors.

After each round, you can generate a ranking list or cross table for players to review — again, either on paper or on a screen.

At the end of the tournament, _Sharly Chess_ can generate a TRF file of the results — the standard format recognized by _FIDE_.

> :information_source: Federation plugins may provide the ability to update directly to an appropriate web site.
> For example, for French tournaments the _FFE_ plugin can automatically convert your tournamnent to a Papi file and upload it to the _Fédération Française des Échecs_ site.
