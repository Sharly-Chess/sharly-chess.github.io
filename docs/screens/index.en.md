# Screens

One of _Sharly Chess_'s flagship features is the ability to display pairings and live results during a tournament. These can be shown on a projector or a screen attached directly to the arbiterâ€™s machine, or even on other devices [connected to the network]({% link docs/network/index.en.md %}).
