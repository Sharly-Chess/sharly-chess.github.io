---

A few weeks after the last major version, version 2.8 introduces several new features:

- **Official support for _Sharly Chess_’s internal pairing engine**:
  We now recommend using the _Sharly Chess_ engine, which allows you to generate pairings that comply with the _FIDE_ Handbook.
  We’ll soon begin the process of getting _Sharly Chess_ officially recognised by the International Federation.

- **Prize calculation**:
  A new interface allows you to define tournament prizes by setting up groups and categories.
  This powerful system handles even complex prize logic to meet organiser needs and save time preparing awards ([details]({% link docs/running-an-event/prize-list.en.md %})).

- **Redesigned management interface**:
  To accommodate this version’s new features (and those still to come), the interface has been reorganised with a collapsible sidebar to give more space to the content.

You’ll also find other minor improvements to help you manage your tournaments:

- check-in list printing;
- printing of relative round performances;
- simplified first-time setup;
- improved logging;
- and more, all detailed in the [recent changes]({% link dev/changelog.en.md %}).
