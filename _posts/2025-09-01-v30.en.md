---

Version 3.0 is the culmination of months of development and marks a new chapter for _Sharly Chess_: this is the first fully autonomous release — tournaments are now stored exclusively in our own database format rather than `.papi` files.

This major change brings several advantages:

- **Much simpler installation**: _Microsoft Access_ drivers are no longer needed
- **Simpler and more intuitive setup** for organisers
- **Freedom to fix unwanted behaviours**, such as boards being reordered when adding pairings manually
- **Improved performance** — everything runs faster
- **macOS support** (Apple Silicon only)

But don’t worry: despite the disappearance of the _Papi_ files, you can still publish the results of your tournaments on the website of the [French Chess Federation](https://www.echecs.asso.fr), from _Sharly Chess_ ;)

Many other new features, improvements and fixes have been added to this release to make running your events even smoother, including:

- An option to [override unrated rapid/blitz ratings by standard ratings]({% link dev/faq.en.md %}#standard-rating)
- Access to pairing information: groups, floaters, history and colour preferences
- Searching of players on the Pairings tab
- A manual tie-break option
- Restoring of archived events
- Entry of unrated and penalty results
- Better security:the program is now recognised as signed by _Microsoft Defender_

See the [full changelog]({% link dev/changelog.en.md %}) for all details.

This new version has already been successfully tested at the 40th Domloup _FIDE_ Open (6 tournaments, 134 participants). It was highly appreciated by the players, the organizer, and of course the arbiters!
