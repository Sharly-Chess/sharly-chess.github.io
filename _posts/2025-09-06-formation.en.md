This Saturday, September 6th, a _Sharly Chess_ training session was held in Romans-sur-Isère, led by Timothy ARMES, one of the developers of the project.

Several well-known figures from the regional chess community were in attendance:
- Claire PERNOUD, Elite Arbiter 2
- Françoise RINGOT, President of the ARA League, _FFE_ Arbiter (Open 2)
- Thierry DELELIS-FANIEN, Vice-President of the ARA League, Elite Arbiter 1
- Alain BEC, Technical Director of the ARA League
- Miguel CALIN, President of the club La Diagonale (Eybens)

The training covered all the essential aspects of running a tournament with _Sharly Chess_:
- creating events and tournaments
- adding and checking in players
- managing pairings
- entering results
- awarding prizes

The end of the session was dedicated to more technical topics, including network configuration and the use of external screens to display results and pairings.

Many thanks to all participants for their interest and constructive feedback. These exchanges help move forward the development of _Sharly Chess_ as a tool made by and for arbiters.
