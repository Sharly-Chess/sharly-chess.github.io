excerpt: "Version 3.2 brings Sharly Chess to the world stage."
---

Version 3.2 is the culmination of over a year of development with one major goal: to bring *Sharly Chess* to the world stage.

The remaining limitations that had previously restricted *Sharly Chess* to use in France have now been removed:

- The plug-in providing features specific to the French Chess Federation is now active only for tournaments hosted in France (i.e., where the federation is set to “FRA”).
- _FIDE_ and national ratings are now handled separately (tournament settings specify which rating type to use).
- All standard FIDE tie-breaks are now available.
- The Baku acceleration system has been implemented.
- The value of the Pairing Allocated Bye can now be adjusted.

{: .note }
> :information_source: **_FIDE_ and national ratings**: for tournaments hosted in France, the _FFE_ plug-in ensures that 
> you continue to get the familiar behaviour regarding player ratings.
> If a player has a _FIDE_ rating, it will always take precedence over their national rating.
>
> :information_source: **Tie-breaks not supported by _Papi_**: ie-breaks not supported by _Papi_ can not be displayed
> on the website of the French Federation but the rankings displayed on the federal website are strictly consistent 
> with those of _Sharly Chess_.

And we didn’t stop there — several great new features have also been added:

- Uploading to **Chess-Results.com** (many thanks to Heinz Herzog for making this possible).
- The ability to print **player norm certificates**, complete with automatic verification of all norm criteria.

With the release of version 3.2, we’re ready to begin the **FIDE endorsement process**!

If you’d like to see *Sharly Chess* offer federation-specific features for your country, please contact your **national chess federation** to express your interest.
