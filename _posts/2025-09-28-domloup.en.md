On Sunday, September 28, the 2026 Brittany Rapid Championship took place in Domloup, bringing together 193 players.

The competition was managed using a beta version of _Sharly Chess_ 3.1, tested in a full-scale real-world setting.

9 rounds at a time control of 12 minutes plus 3 seconds per move were played using an accelerated Swiss system for the Brittany Championship,
and a round-robin format for the “Little Pawns“ tournament welcoming young beginners.

Thanks to the simplified alphabetical display of pairings and players entering their own results, the day’s schedule was kept perfectly on track:
first round at 9:45am and prize-giving wrapped up by 5pm!

_Sharly Chess_ was pushed to the limit, with almost every available feature being used — especially the new features introduced in versions 3.0 and 3.1.

The [delegation]({% link docs/network/access-levels.en.md %}) was organized as follows:
- result entry delegated to players on three dedicated devices with the access level “Result entry on public screens“,
- check-in and result modifications to two arbiters with the access level “Section arbitration“,
- all other operations (pairings, printing, etc.) were done in administrator mode on the _Sharly Chess_ server.

The “Little Pawns“, who were for many experiencing their very first competition, also entered their own results independently, without any difficulty.

Many prizes were awarded to participants, some of which could be combined:
- General ranking of the 17th Domloup Rapid Open:
  - trophy for the winner
  - €900 in prizes for the top 6 finishers
  - Hort system sharing
  - for all participants
- Category rankings of the Brittany Rapid Championship:
  - €100 for the overall champion
  - prizes by placement
  - reserved for licensed Breton players only (16 mixed/female categories)
- Rankings for qualification to the Roza Lallemand Trophy:
  - qualification for the top two women
  - reserved for licensed Breton women only
- General ranking of the “Little Pawns“ tournament:
  - cup for the winner
  - medals for the next two

Prize calculation is always a sensitive moment in tournament management: it must be error-free and quick so the awards can be handed out as early as possible.
Thanks to _Sharly Chess_’s comprehensive prize management interface, **four sets of prizes, partly combinable**, were created, and prize allocation was calculated by _Sharly Chess_ as soon as the final round ended, then passed to the treasurer to prepare the checks for the winners.

The network configuration used was as follows:
- the server, used by the chief arbiter for screen configuration and pairings, connected:
  - to the internet for real-time result publication;
  - to a small Wi-Fi router making it visible to other network clients;
- two laptops (used by assistant arbiters) for check-in;
- three projectors connected to three laptops, each running a display controller to:
  - show pairings alphabetically before rounds;
  - show pairings by board during rounds;
- three devices for entering results (two for the Brittany Championship and one for the “Little Pawns“);
  - one standalone Android projector (XGimi MoGo 2) for showing “Little Pawns“ pairings.

With the exception of the _Sharly Chess_ server on Windows 11, all other computers used were very old machines (10–20 years) running a minimal operating system (_Linux Mint_) and a web browser connected to the server.
