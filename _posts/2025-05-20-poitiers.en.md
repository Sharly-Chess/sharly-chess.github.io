On Sunday, May 18, 2025, the first _Sharly Chess_ tournament took place, run from start to finish without _Papi_'s help, using only the internal pairing engine _bbpPairings_.

Version 2.6.2 has been used in experimental mode (to use _bbpPairings_) on a standard network:
- a Wi-Fi router connected to the internet via 4G;
- the _Sharly Chess_ server connected to the router, with an extended display duplicated on two giant screens for display to players;
- a tablet for players to enter results, also connected to the router.

Many thanks to Pierre LAPEYRE, the arbiter of the tournament sponsor of Papi-web and then _Sharly Chess_ for many years, for participating in this great first experiment, many others will come!
