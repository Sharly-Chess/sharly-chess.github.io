excerpt: Papi-web is now Sharly Chess. Version 2.6 brings major performance improvements, a new website, enhanced pairing tools, screen controllers for arbiters, and a streamlined interface.
---

It’s official: Papi-web has changed its name and is now called **_Sharly Chess_**!

The main highlights of version 2.6 are as follows:

* A **very significant performance improvement** - you’ll be surprised at speed increase across the entire application (at least 10 times faster!), with testing done on events involving several hundred players (up to 1,800 players across 16 tournaments).
* **A new website** — **[https://sharly-chess.com](https://sharly-chess.com)** — where you can explore the features through documentation.designed to make using _Sharly Chess_ simple and intuitive, in both French and English (the more technical documentation is still available on the project’s [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sharly-chess/sharly-chess)).
* **A new “Pairings” tab** to handle all pairing operations (manual pairings, round-robins, and double round-robins), with the exception of Swiss pairings.
* **Display Controllers**, for arbiters who wish to manage public screens directly from the _Sharly Chess_ server.
* **A simplified main menu**, for improved ergonomics.

{: .note }
> :information_source: Swiss pairing is already implemented in the application, based on the bbpPairings engine, but it is not available natively in version 2.6.
> If you're interested in testing this feature before its public release, feel free to join our [beta testers on Discord](https://discord.gg/bB5ckbsjCD)!
