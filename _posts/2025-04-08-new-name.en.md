The project, managed by **Pascal** since 2013 in his garage, has been significantly strengthened since version 2.0 by the addition of three new developers:

* In August 2023, **Sammy** implemented tie-break calculations and professionalized the development methodology.
* In November 2024, **Timothy** overhauled the web interface and initiated the plugin architecture.
* In January 2025, **Youri** made numerous improvements to the application's internal architecture.

The Papi-web project will soon change its name. A brand new association, called "Sharly Chess", aims to promote and facilitate the development of Papi-web, now Sharly Chess, and to ensure its governance (strategy, direction, prioritization, distribution policy, etc.).

So, you can now call your favorite application "**Sharly Chess**"!
