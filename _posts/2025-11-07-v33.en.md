Version 3.3 has been released!
This update focuses on three main areas:

## Streamlined UI

We've made a number of improvements to make the interface cleaner and more consistent:

* Default settings for tournaments, prizes, and screens have been moved out of the _Event_ settings and into their respective pages.
  This makes them easier to find when needed and reduces the complexity of the _Event_ configuration.
* All dialogs have been reviewed and made more compact, so more information fits on screen.
  This minimizes the need for scrolling and improves readability.

## Place Cards

You can now print place cards directly from Sharly Chess. Three types are available:

* **Board Place Cards** — one per board in the tournament
* **Player Place Cards** — one per player
* **Round Place Cards** — one per round for each board

Basic templates are included, and you can also design your own!

## French Schools Plugin

A new plugin is available to help manage **French school competitions**.
It adds an easy way to record each player’s school, and automatically exports this as the club name when generating Papi files.
