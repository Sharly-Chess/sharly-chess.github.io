- Publishing rules (via the `Actions` menu on the tournments card)
- Retrieving fees (via the `Actions` menu on the tournments card)

This version also includes:
- Instant notifications on the Players and Pairings tab when new checkins or results are entered on user screens, so that you know to refresh your page to see the latest information.
- A lottery feature, which allows players to be randomly drawn from tournaments.
- Tournament exports in PGN and TRF 16 formats.
