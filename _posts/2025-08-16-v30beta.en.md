excerpt: "Sharly Chess is looking for volunteers to test the first beta version 3.0!"
---

Version 3.0 of Sharly Chess will be the first fully standalone version, for which tournaments are now stored exclusively in the application database (`*.papi` files not used anymore).

This deep change allows for:

- **Easier installation** (no Access driver required).
- **Easier use** (all event information in one place, in `events/*.sce` files).
- **Increased performance** (slowness due to Access databases disappeared).
- **Sharly Chess now works on MacOS** (Apple Silicon Macs only).
- **A few new features**, such as no automatic board renumbering when manually adding pairings.

**We are looking for beta testers for this new version**, which we expect to release as a final version by the end of August (based on your feedback).

Please let us know of any issues you encounter on [Discord](https://discord.gg/WGG87eJzQZ) (priority),
by email ([support@sharly-chess.com](mailto:support@sharly-chess.com)) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/sharly-chess/sharly-chess/issues),
you can also let us know if you're not experiencing any issues :-)

Note: _Sharly Chess_ no longer uses _Papi_ files, but of course you can still submit your tournaments to the [French Chess Federation](https://www.echecs.asso.fr) website!

Thank you in advance for your participation!
