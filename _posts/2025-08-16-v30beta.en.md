excerpt: "Be among the first to try Sharly Chess 3.0 — our first beta is ready for testing!"
---

Version 3.0 of _Sharly Chess_ will be the first fully standalone version, for which tournaments are now stored exclusively in the application database (`*.papi` files not used anymore).

This major change allows for:

- **Simpler installation** (no _Access_ driver required).
- **Simpler use** (all event information in one place, in `events/*.sce` files).
- **Increased performance** (slowdowns from _Access_ databases are gone).
- **Native support on macOS** (Apple Silicon Macs only).
- **Several new features**, such as no automatic board renumbering when manually adding pairings.

**We are looking for beta testers for this new version**, which we expect to release in final form by the end of August (depending on your feedback).

Please let us know of any issues you encounter on [Discord](https://discord.gg/WGG87eJzQZ) (preferred),
by email ([support@sharly-chess.com](mailto:support@sharly-chess.com)) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/sharly-chess/sharly-chess/issues).
And if everything works smoothly for you, we’d love to hear that too!

Note: _Sharly Chess_ no longer uses _Papi_ files, but of course you can still submit your tournaments to the [French Chess Federation](https://www.echecs.asso.fr) website!

Thank you in advance for your help and feedback!
