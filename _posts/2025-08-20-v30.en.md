---

Version 3.0 is the culmination of months of development and marks a new chapter for _Sharly Chess_.

This is the first fully autonomous release — tournaments are now stored exclusively in our own database format rather than `.papi` files.
This major change brings several advantages:

- **Much simpler installation**.
- **Simpler and more intuitive setup** for organisers.
- **Freedom to fix unwanted behaviours**, such as boards being reordered when adding pairings manually.
- **Improved performance** — everything runs faster.
- **macOS support** (Apple Silicon only).

But don’t worry — you can still export your tournaments to `.papi` format for upload to the [French Chess Federation](https://www.echecs.asso.fr) site.

This release also includes many smaller improvements and fixes to make running your events even smoother.
See the [full changelog]({% link dev/changelog.en.md %}) for all details.
