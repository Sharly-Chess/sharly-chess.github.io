_Sharly Chess_ version 3.4 is now available!

## Event Export

To facilitate event sharing, it is now possible to export events, specifying whether or not to include players, their personal data (email and phone number), and the credentials used to publish results online.

## Prize Receipts

To meet the needs expressed by some organizers, prize receipts allow for recording the collection of prizes from players.

## Removal of Browser Translations

Browser abusive translations have been reported (even including player names!), so browsers are now asked to stop translating interface content.

## Timers

The timer management interface has been simplified, and timers now appear on the rotators.

## Linux

Linux bundles are now available for Intel/AMD and ARM architectures.

Beta testers have reported successful installations on Ubuntu, Mint, and Fedora ([details]({% link docs/getting-started/installation-linux.en.md %}), but we are still far from a stable and fully supported distribution for all Linux platforms. 
The _Sharly Chess_ developers are unable to provide support for this aspect and are looking for Linux experts. Get in touch!

## Other Features

- A new option allows you to specify the date on which player categories are based.
- A "Status" field has been added to the _Chess-Results_ export for some federations.

👉 Check out the [full changelog]({% link dev/changelog.en.md %}) for all the details.
