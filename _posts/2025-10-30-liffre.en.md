excerpt: "For the first time, a player norm has been awarded at a tournament entirely managed by Sharly Chess."
---

The 11th edition of the Liffré International Open took place from October 18 to 24, 2025, directed by Dominique RUHLMANN (longtime user of the now-defunct Papi-web, supporter of _Sharly Chess_ and also developer of the _ChessEvent_ platform).

The competition saw the achievement of a first player norm in a tournament managed from start to finish by _Sharly Chess_ (International Master norm for Louis VALLÉE)!

Une occasion en or pour tester la nouvelle fonctionnalité d'impression des normes de joueur de _Sharly Chess_, introduite en version 3.2 :

And let's also congratulate Sammy PLAT on his first International Arbiter norm, he's also one of the developers of _Sharly Chess_ in his spare time ;-)
