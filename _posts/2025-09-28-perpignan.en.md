On Sunday, September 28, an open rapid tournament took place in Perpignan, as part of the 2026 Roussillon Circuit, bringing together 84 players.

The tournament, fully managed with _Sharly Chess_, led to the awarding of a FIDE Arbiter norm to Stéphane LABORDE — a first!

A big thank you to Stéphane (one of the very first users of _Papi-web_) for trusting _Sharly Chess_, and to chief arbiter Patrice CAPITANIO, whom we’re confident will soon join the _Sharly Chess_ community.

The setup was as follows:
- the _Sharly Chess_ server, connected to the internet,
- with a mobile phone providing the internet connection,
- a simple Wi-Fi repeater/mini-router (no larger than a USB charger) connected to it,
- and then 3 tablets for result entry + 2 PCs connected to the router.

The Wi-Fi relay router allowed:
- avoiding overloading the smartphone (its simultaneous connections are limited),
- and offloading its power usage as well, since it only had to handle one Wi-Fi connection (the router). Everything ran extremely fast and smoothly.
